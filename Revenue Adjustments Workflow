I prototyped a Revenue Adjustments workflow in Lovable for a requirements brainstorming session with my team. Use this example to copy into a Vibe code tool and see it come to life:

This is intentionally straightforward—something every Finance team understands.

The workflow today: An analyst wants to submit a revenue adjustment for $12,000 because a customer invoice was posted to the wrong product line.
They fill a form, attach support, email the controller, wait for feedback, redo fields… lots of back-and-forth. Its simple in paper but when you work through the product requirements, every team imagines this flow differently. Let’s see how we would Vibe code this to bring in clarity:

Here’s what you might prototype in 4 minutes:

Prompt: You are an internal Finance AI assistant helping Accounting teams create revenue adjustment drafts.Your outputs must be auditable, deterministic, structured, and safe for a corporate Finance environment.No guessing. No hallucinated numbers. Use only the sample data provided.

Create a vibe-coded prototype of a Revenue Adjustment Request Template including:
Input section (what the analyst fills)
AI-generated draft summary
Validation checks (materiality, support completeness, multi-entity impact)
Suggested explanation wording
Reviewer actions (Approve / Edit / Request Evidence)
Audit trail fields (timestamps, user ID placeholders)
Two alternative layout styles (Structured Table + Narrative Form)
Make this a practical, simple prototype that Finance teams can react to.
Structure the Output as Follows

1. Analyst Input Form (Mock UI)
Show fields with sample values pre-filled:
Amount
Adjustment Direction
Product Line (current vs corrected)
Supporting Documentation Required
Free-text explanation
Risk flags

2. AI Drafted Adjustment Summary
A structured template including:
Adjustment Overview
Reason for Adjustment
Customer & Contract Reference
Supporting Evidence List
Auto-Checks (materiality, duplicates, multi-entity impact)

3. Reviewer Panel (Mocked Buttons)
Represent the workflow flow:
Decision ( Approve/Reject with logs timestamp + reviewer ID)
Comment
Approved by

Include Audit fields like 
“Created By:”
“Created On:”
“Reviewed By:”
“Reviewed On:”
“Evidence Attached:”
“Adjustment ID:”

Tone Requirements
Compliance-safe
No speculation or invented reasoning
Clear, factual, neutral
Use short sentences and readable formatting
